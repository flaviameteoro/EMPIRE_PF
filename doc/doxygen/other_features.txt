\section gendata Generating artificial observations

EMPIRE can generate artificial observations easily and quickly.

Model specific operations required: \n
 - \link h \endlink
 - \link rhalf \endlink
 - \link qhalf \endlink

In \link pf_control::parse_pf_parameters empire.nml \endlink set the following variables:
- \link pf_control::pf_control_type::gen_data gen_data \endlink = .true.

The system then should be run with a single ensemble member and a single EMPIRE process, i.e.
\code{.sh}
mpirun -np 1 model : -np 1 empire
\endcode

\section Observations Observations
To use real observations (i.e. those not generated automatically in twin experiment mode) the user must change the subroutine \link get_observation_data get_observation_data\endlink in model_specific.f90.

When called, \link get_observation_data get_observation_data\endlink must return the vector of observations \f$y\f$ that corresponds to the observation on, subsequently to, the current timestep.

\section detens Running a deterministic ensemble

EMPIRE can simply integrate forward in time an ensemble of models.

In \link pf_control::parse_pf_parameters empire.nml \endlink set the following variables:
- \link pf_control::pf_control_type::filter filter \endlink = 'DE'

\section stochens Running a stochastic ensemble

EMPIRE can integrate forward in time an ensemble of models whilst adding stochastic forcing.

Model specific operations required: \n
 - \link qhalf \endlink

In \link pf_control::parse_pf_parameters empire.nml \endlink set the following variables:
- \link pf_control::pf_control_type::filter filter \endlink = 'SE'


\section redirectingoutput Redirecting the output from EMPIRE
This feature can be used to suppress output from EMPIRE STDOUT.

See \link output_empire::open_emp_o open_emp_o \endlink for more information.

\section rankhistograms Outputting rank histograms

This is controlled by \link pf_control::pf_control_type::use_talagrand use_talagrand \endlink in \link pf_control::parse_pf_parameters empire.nml \endlink  and for more information see \link histogram_data::load_histogram_data load_histogram_data \endlink.

\section trajectories Outputting trajectories of model variables

This is controlled by \link pf_control::pf_control_type::use_traj use_traj \endlink in \link pf_control::parse_pf_parameters empire.nml \endlink  and for more information see \link traj_data::setup_traj setup_traj \endlink.

\section ensemble_covariances Outputting covariances of the ensemble

EMPIRE has the ability to output the ensemble covariance matrices throughout the run. This is controlled by the optional namelist &mat_pf in @ref empire.nml. For more information see @ref matrix_pf::matrix_pf_data. Note however, that this will output a large matrix -- if the state dimension of the model is large, this is likely not a good thing to compute! This feature is not available with empire version 3 communications.

\section rmse Outputting Root Mean Squared Errors

In a twin experiment, where EMPIRE has generated a "truth", EMPIRE can output the following:
\f$ \sqrt{(  \frac{1}{N_x}\sum_{i=1}^{N_x}(\bar{x}_i-x^t_i)^2 )} \f$
where
\f$N_x\f$ is the state dimension (\link sizes::state_dim state_dim \endlink), \f$\bar{x}\f$ is the ensemble mean, \f$x^t\f$ is the truth, and \f$i\f$ is an index running over each component of the state vector.

Note that in the case where the model has different variables, that are on different scales, this is probably not a good measure. For example, if one component of the state vector is measured in units of "apples per pie" and another is measured in "oranges per country per decade", this measure of RMSE will combine the two. Hence the latter should have much larger scale than the former, so this RMSE measure will be dominated by the errors in the components with greater variability.

@todo Add option to output RMSE fields and Variance fields
